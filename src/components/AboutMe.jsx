      <p>
        Hello! I'm a full stack developer with a deep passion for coding and a
        love for the outdoors. My journey into web development has been fueled
        by a desire to create dynamic, user-friendly applications that make an
        impact. From designing intuitive front-end interfaces to building robust
        back-end systems, I enjoy the full spectrum of development and
        continuously strive to improve my skills. When I'm not coding, you'll
        often find me outdoors, hiking scenic trails, or overlanding/offroading,
        or out on the golf course! I find that the balance between the structure
        of development and the freedom of being outside helps keep me inspired
        and grounded. With experience in a range of technologies, I aim to build
        efficient, scalable, and creative solutions that meet user needs. I'm
        always eager to collaborate on new projects, push the boundaries of what
        I can create, and keep growing as a developer.
      </p>
